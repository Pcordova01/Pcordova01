Hi, I’m Pedro Cordova — a Computer Science student at UTSA with a growing focus on cybersecurity operations, Linux systems, and Python scripting. This portfolio showcases hands-on projects that simulate real-world scenarios such as incident response, log analysis, threat detection, and system hardening.

I enjoy working in terminal-based environments, building tools with Python and SQL, and diving deep into security audits and adversary simulations. I’m passionate about understanding how systems are attacked—and more importantly—how to defend them through training, experimentation, and collaborative problem-solving.

## Objective
I aim to apply my technical skills in Linux, Python, SQL, and cybersecurity auditing to projects involving threat detection, compliance, and incident response, while continuing to grow through hands-on simulations, continuous learning, and team-based challenges.
