I'm Pedro Cordova — a Computer Science student at UTSA with a strong interest in cybersecurity operations, Linux environments, Python scripting, and system auditing. This portfolio highlights hands-on projects and scenarios focused on incident response, log analysis, risk assessments, and system hardening.

I enjoy working in terminal-based environments, building practical tools with Python and SQL, and simulating real-world audit and security challenges. I’m passionate about protecting systems, analyzing threats, and continually improving through training, collaboration, and applied practice.

## Objective
To apply my skills in Linux, Python, SQL, and cybersecurity auditing to real-world scenarios involving threat detection, system hardening, and incident response—while continuing to grow through hands-on simulations, continuous learning, and collaborative problem-solving.
